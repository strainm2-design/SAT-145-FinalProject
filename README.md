# SAT-145-FinalProject
This is the replication package for my STA145 class. I analyzed Legislatures in New Jersey and compared education level achieved against political party affiliation to see if there is a correlation between the two.


# Instructions
To access and utilize the script, open the "STA145-STRAINM2.R" file, which contains the code for my project. To access the dataset, open the "Politics 4-NJ Leg - Data Table Tabular (1).csv file.

# Data
The data collected for this project was New Jersey Legislators and their political party affiliation, as well as the level of education each legislator has achieved. The main goal of analysis was to see if there was a statistically significant relationship between the two variables. I analyzed the relationship by putting the number of legislators who are associated with each political party and the highest degree they recieved into a contingency table. 

# Operationalization
To operationalize political party affiliation, I went to njleg.state.nj and took down the total number of Legislators in New Jersey. I then went through and assigned a dummy variable to each party. Legislators who affiliated with the democratic party got a 1, while legislators affiliated with the republican party recieved a 2. There are no New Jersey legislators affiliated with any other party, however, the "other" category was operationalized with a 3.

Level of education recieved was operationalized in a similar manner, with numbers being assigned to each category. Legislators who only completed up to high school recieved a 1, those who have recieved up to a bachelors recieved a 2, those who recieved a master's degree got a 3, those who recieved a JD/MD degree got a 4, and those with a PhD recieved a 5. All information was found on njleg.state.nj.
